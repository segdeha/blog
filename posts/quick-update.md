Last blog entry February 9. Contacted recruiter in New Zealand February 14. Life accelerated to warp speed in matter of days. Coming up for air.

========

It snowed on February 14. Because it snowed, I didn’t go in to work. Because I didn’t go in to work, I had time to poke around [a New Zealand jobs site](http://www.seek.co.nz/). Because I poked around a New Zealand jobs site, I got in touch with the cool people at [Potentia](http://potentia.co.nz/). Because I got in touch with Potentia, I got an interview with [a cool company in the far north of NZ](http://vianet.travel/). Because I (apparently) did well in the interview, I got a job offer with said company. Because I got a job offer _in New Zealand,_ I **moved** to New Zealand!

Moving here took a lot of mental space. Maybe it’s not that way for everyone, but I suspect it is to some degree. In any case, I have had other things on my mind than blogging for the past 4 months. Things like: finding a place to live in a foreign country where I didn’t now anyone, securing a work permit so I could start working, starting work so I could get my own rental house, buying the bare essentials for said rental house, remembering to drive on the left side of the road, etc., etc., etc.

Anyway, I don’t want to make any promises, but I hope to be blogging occasionally again now that I am settling in in my new home, New Zealand!

PS: We’re hiring!
