========

People who know me might find it amusing, if not ironic, that I&#8217;m riffing on what&#8217;s cool. As the dad to two pre-teen daughters, I&#8217;m well aware that I&#8217;m not hip. But, perhaps with experience comes insight, so I offer my 2 cents on the subject anyway.

<p class="outdent">Today&#8217;s was a crisp, Spring, New Mexico morning, cold with bright shining sun, perfect for a morning constitutional. So, I went for a walk. It felt good. I hadn&#8217;t done it in a while.</p>
<p>People were out cycling, running, horseback riding, and, like me, walking. I noticed Canada geese and a few varieties of ducks as I crossed the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>As I was walking back across the wide, pedestrian bridge that runs parallel to busy Alameda Avenue, I passed a man, around my age, by himself, with a pair of large binoculars around his neck. It appeared to me that he was out to do some bird watching. And, what a great day to do so! I tried making eye contact with him to say &#8216;good morning,&#8217; but he deftly avoided my glances. I wondered if he was self-conscious about what he was up to. That got me thinking.</p>
<p>Of course, I could have misread him, but I think the reaction I think I saw is all too common in circa 2010 American culture. We are inundated&#8212;no matter how well we insulate ourselves from it&#8212;by messages about what&#8217;s cool and what&#8217;s not. River kayaking? Mountain biking? Rock climbing? Cool! Bird watching? Enh, not so much.</p>
<p>You know where I&#8217;m going with this, but I&#8217;ll say it anyway: internalizing these messages, taking them to heart and feeling worse about yourself, this is misguided.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s cool isn&#8217;t <em>what</em> you&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s <em>that</em> you&#8217;re doing. I could care less what a person&#8217;s into. What&#8217;s cool to me is when someone loves something enough to take the time to learn a lot about it, then goes and does it, gets into the flow, and really enjoys their bad self.</p>
<p>I mentioned my pre-teen daughters. One is into playing drums and reading comic books. The other loves ancient Egypt and wants to be a stand-up comic or fashion designer when she grows up. These interests couldn&#8217;t be more different, and I don&#8217;t know what their peers think, but to me it&#8217;s all extremely cool. They have things they love to do. They&#8217;re happier, more fulfilled little creatures because they have stuff they love. <em>They&#8217;re more interesting because they have interests.</em></p>
<p>So collect stamps, quilt, write cheesy poetry, build model airplanes, carve chainsaw sculptures, play accordion rather than electric guitar, do whatever makes <em>you</em> happy. Don&#8217;t worry about the people you fear might judge you because what you like isn&#8217;t cool. No one else gets to be the arbiter of what&#8217;s worth your time. The people who would tell you you&#8217;re not cool, don&#8217;t fear them, <em>pity them.</em> They&#8217;re misguided.</p>
