========

Call me crazy. I quit what was in many ways a dream job at <a href="http://www.apple.com/">The Cupertino Fruit Company</a> to take 6 months off to recharge, reset, and reassess what&#8217;s next. I&#8217;m 2 months in. Let&#8217;s take stock of how it&#8217;s going, shall we?

========

<p>One way to take stock would be just to send you to this and let you judge for yourself: <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/segdehabbatical/">#segdehabbatical</a></p>
<p>But, that would be cheating. So, instead, let&#8217;s start with a review of the highlights to-date….</p>
<ul id="gallery-1" class="gallery">
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/kings-canyon.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Camped with Valerie and her family in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/seki/">King&#8217;s Canyon</a>. Who knew California had so many 14ers? OK, lots of people. Still impressive!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/alvord-jeeps.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Camped for a week in the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/or/districts/burns/recreation/steens-mtn.php">Steens Mountain Wilderness</a> with my family. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchglen,_Oregon">closest town</a> was 35 miles away, population 12. Add &#8220;race Jeeps across a dry lake bed&#8221; to your bucket list. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/arenal-hanging-bridge.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Spent 2 weeks in Costa Rica, mostly in the lovely beach town of Tamarindo, sightseeing and visiting with my longtime freelance client who runs <a href="http://isls.com">Spanish language schools and camps</a> there. Spent a weekend in Arenal, including a hike through the rainforest canopy on <em>los puentes colgantes</em> (hanging bridges). Spectacular! I can&#8217;t recommend Costa Rica highly enough. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://medium.com/@dana_98871/5-reasons-costa-rica-is-a-great-destination-for-your-family-vacation-84da0af2b02b">great for families</a>!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/portland-bernie-rally.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Attended the 28,000 person strong <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/bernie-sanders-rallies-2016-grassroots-support-121512.html" title="You can actually see me in this article's hero photo in my blue Bernie shirt in the bottom left if you know where to look!">Bernie Sanders rally</a> in Portland with <a href="http://david.hedges.name">my dad</a> and younger daughter. The energy was amazing!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/seattle-ferry.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Spent a fantastic long weekend in and around Seattle that included catching up with old friends, seeing <a href="http://www.thehootenhallers.com/">one of the best shows of my life</a> at <a href="http://musiconthemounds.com/">Music on the Mounds</a>, jamming with my sister on her back patio, and speaking to a group of women developers at the <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, I have had a series of great experiences that I would not have had I been toiling away at my day job this whole time. For that, I am so grateful. It is a privilege to be in a position where I can take this time for myself.</p>
<p>Still, I can&#8217;t help but feel a little antsy a third of the way through my time off. I&#8217;m feeling the need to start turning my attention to the growing list of ideas and projects on the whiteboard in my apartment. I know I&#8217;ll be in Portland, Oregon, by the end of the year. I just don&#8217;t yet know what I&#8217;ll be doing for work. Time to figure that out!</p>
<p>After I spend spend a few days in Austin next week, that is….</p>

<h3>Update: November 3, 2015</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m back to share what I&#8217;ve been up to over the 10½ weeks since I first posted this. <strong>TL;dr:</strong> More travel, plus adventures closer to home, and the beginnings of me poking my head up to survey possibilities in the world of the working.</p>

<ul id="gallery-2" class="gallery">
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/austin-toni-price.jpg" alt="">
		<p>I dragged <a href="https://twitter.com/craigalimo">Craig</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_jjphillips">Jayson</a> (kicking and screaming, I assure you) to Austin for a few days for some great music and food. <a href="http://toniprice.net/">Toni Price</a> (pictured above) did not disappoint, 18 years after the first and only other time I saw her live. <a href="http://www.labarbecue.com/">la Barbecue</a> also did not disappoint, though that was more for Craig&#8217;s and Jayson&#8217;s sakes since I&#8217;m <a href="https://instagram.com/p/624S27p5l_/">vegetarian</a> and all.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/oakland-bgc.jpg" alt="">
		<p>I volunteered as a technical assistant for a coding day for girls ages 8–18 through <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a>. The task was to build <a href="http://segdeha.com/bgc/mygame/">a simple game</a>. Preparing for the day, I searched around and wasn&#8217;t able to find any game sprites of Black girl heroes. So, I commissioned <a href="http://musiamure.daportfolio.com/">a designer</a> to create one. We used it in the course and I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/segdeha/black-girl-hero-game-sprite">released it for others to use</a>, free of charge.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/paris-eiffel-tower.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Valerie spent 2 weeks in France on an art residency, so I joined her for the 2nd week. We stayed a few days in <a href="https://instagram.com/p/7-mdKyp5t0/">Noyers</a>, a tiny, medieval town of 750, then toured <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8A3Mg7p5p3/">some</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8BGA5pJ5lg/">really</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8DbU-Op5vc/">old</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8DspPmJ5u4/">stuff</a>, before heading to <a href="https://instagram.com/p/8GJ1PvJ5ve/">Orléans</a> for a day to visit my friend, Camille, and then to Paris. France was more beautiful than I imagined.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/sf-highland-games.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Closer to home, I went with friends to the <a href="http://www.thescottishgames.com/">150th Scottish Highland Games</a> in Pleasanton where I met the pictured pup, a &#8220;Lurcher&#8221; which is a cross between a Greyhound and a Scottish Deer Hound. Lovely animal!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/sf-calibrate.jpg" alt="">
		<p>I attended the first ever <a href="http://www.calibratesf.com/">Calibrate SF</a>, a day-long conference for engineering managers. Michael Lopp (a.k.a. <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/">Rands in Repose</a>, pictured above) was the featured speaker, but the talks all day long were really high caliber. Met some great people and had some really good conversations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/sf-back-to-the-future-day.jpg" alt="">
		<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not news that October 21, 2015, was <a href="http://www.october212015.com/">Back to the Future Day</a>, the day to which Doc and Marty travel in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/">Back to the Future, Part II</a>. I went with some of Valerie&#8217;s friends to an &#8220;interruption&#8221; of the movie put on by <a href="http://sfsketchfest.com/">SF Sketchfest</a> at the <a href="http://www.castrotheatre.com/">Castro Theatre</a>. They had 4 comedians sitting in the front row with microphones, talking and making jokes over the movie while it played. It was pretty hilarious.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/ashland-horse.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Nothing makes you feel older than visiting your daughter just weeks into her first year at <a href="http://www.sou.edu">university</a>. In addition to touring campus (which is filled with deer at night!), we watched a thrilling New Zealand win in the <a href="http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/121138">Rugby World Cup Finals</a>, after which she ripped off a rather epic <a href="https://twitter.com/Alice_Gallifrey/status/660571088796016640">first tweet</a> later in the day while shopping. So proud.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, for the last 5 weeks or so, I&#8217;ve been doing some freelance web development work. It&#8217;s been challenging in some ways being an individual contributor again after having been a manager for the last 5 years. But, I&#8217;ve learned a ton and am able to tick off as completed another of the goals I set for myself when I started this whole sabbatical thing.</p>

<p>What comes next? Good question. The goal all along has been to be in Portland, Oregon, by the end of the year. That&#8217;s fast approaching, so that will be probably my main focus over the next couple of months. Once I&#8217;m there, I&#8217;m still not sure what I&#8217;m going to do. And that&#8217;s…OK.</p>

<h3>Update: December 12, 2015</h3>

<p>Exactly 6 months after I left Apple, I hereby declare #segdehabbatical over. Nothing really changes tomorrow, it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;ll be called &#8220;life&#8221; instead of &#8220;sabbatical.&#8221; The last 5½ weeks have been eventful, as has the whole 6 months.</p>

<ul id="gallery-3" class="gallery">
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/portland-kennedy-school.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Flew up to Portlandia for the 100th anniversary of <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/KennedySchool">The Kennedy School</a>. My <a href="http://david.hedges.name/">dad</a> and uncle spoke at the day-long celebration about Mina Parsons, my great-grandmother and the 1st principal of the school back in 1915. She was one tough cookie!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/sf-lost-church-nataly-dawn.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Valerie & I saw the lovely and talented <a href="http://natalydawn.tumblr.com/">Nataly Dawn</a> at <a href="http://thelostchurch.com/">The Lost Church</a>. Wow, such an amazing, intimate venue!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/oakland-starbucks-cup.jpg" alt="">
		<p>I (obviously) won the Starbucks cup decorating contest at our friends&#8217; holiday party.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="/-/img/segdehabbatical/burlingame-party-totchos.jpg" alt="">
		<p>We had an open (soon to be former) house party. It was epic, stretching all afternoon and into the night. Much food was eaten (<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=totchos">totchos</a> pictured), much drink was drunk, but most importantly, we got to catch up with 40 or 50 of our dearest friends before we depart at the end of the month.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I had some deep revelations to reveal here after my 6 month break. The time has flown by, to be honest, so maybe insight will come with a little more time to process it all. One thing I didn&#8217;t realize is how many people I know have done something similar. I&#8217;ve heard many tales of purpose-full breaks of 3 months to a year or more from folks I didn&#8217;t expect to have taken that leap.</p>

<p>We only get one shot at this life, so I applaud anyone who can and does take some time to slow down and reassess. You can&#8217;t focus on what&#8217;s important to you if you don&#8217;t take time to figure out what it is!</p>

<p><a href="http://valeriewitte.com">Valerie</a> and I are now busily packing up our little apartment for the move north. We roll out on 12/31, so time&#8217;s a wastin&#8217; if you want to get together. Hit us up! Otherwise, we&#8217;ll see you in Portland when you come to visit! 😉</p>
