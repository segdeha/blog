========

In case you missed our <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/blog/2006/09/12/announcing-sundial">announcement</a>, we recently released a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/">Mac OS X Dashboard</a> widget that allows you to track time in <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>. It's called <a href="http://www.clearwired.com/sundial/">Sundial</a>, and, despite having built <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/">several widgets</a> before, I learned a ton from working on it.

========

<p class="outdent">I want to share my newfound knowledge with y'all, but there is a small problem. I have other work to do! So, I thought I'd ask you, dear reader, to comment below and let me know which of the following topics you would most like to hear more about. I'll write up my thoughts, code snippets, etc. prioritizing them according to your feedback.</p>

<h3>Sundial taught me...</h3>

<ol>
  <li>How to read values from a widget's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/Dashboard_Ref/DashboardPlist/chapter_4_section_1.html">Info.plist</a> file in just one line of JavaScript.</li>
  <li>How to add <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_optgroup.asp">option groups</a> to a select list via JavaScript.</li>
  <li>How easy it is to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_ProgTopics/Articles/Localization.html">localize widgets</a> in Mac OS X.</li>
  <li>How to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base 64</a> encode a string in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>How handy it is to have on-hand a JavaScript method that emulates PHP's <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php">sprintf</a> function.</li>
  <li>How to emulate Internet Explorer's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/methods/removenode.asp">removeNode</a> JavaScript method in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a>.</li>
  <li>More than I ever wanted to know about the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">XMLHttpRequest</a> object.</li>
  <li>That, though extremely useful in a lot of cases, sometimes you can't rely on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_ProgTopics/Articles/AppleClasses.html">AppleClasses</a> to do exactly what you need.</li>
  <li>That, despite its overwhelming grooviness, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype.js</a> can't do everything.</li>
  <li>That, despite not being able to do everything, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">prototype.js</a> is pretty darn groovy and makes working with <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a> calls nearly painless.</li>
  <li>That, when it comes to Dashboard widget development, it's good to be part of a <a href="http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/dashboard-dev">community</a>.</li>
  <li>That <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> is the cat's meow, in so many ways.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let's hear it! Where shall I start...</p>
