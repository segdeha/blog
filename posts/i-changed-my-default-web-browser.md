Not that anyone but me really cares.

<p class="outdent">I'm a web developer. Now, I don't know if other web developers do this, but I keep three web browsers open at all times.</p>
<p>I don't mean three web browser <em>windows,</em> either. I mean that I keep <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>, and <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> open and available always, usually with more than one window open, all loaded up with boatloads of tabs. Scoff if you will, but I have my reasons.</p>
<p>Used to be that I used Safari as my main development browser (meaning, I would preview pages I was working on there first) as well as my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> feed reader. Then, I would use Firefox for looking up programming-related information and for more serious debugging using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">Firebug</a>, <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a>, or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/">Web Developer extension</a>. In Camino, I would have <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">My Yahoo!</a> and other articles up in tabs for me to switch to for a quick news fix.</p>
<p>No longer.</p>
<p>I have now switched to using Camino as my main development browser, Firefox for heavy debugging, with Safari pretty much relegated just to being my RSS feed reader.</p>
<p>Why the switch? Of the three, Camino seems the most robust. When I'm working on something, the last thing I need is for the browser to crash. I have been burned  this way too many times by Safari. I have never used Firefox for my main development browser (despite its excellent extensions) because it is a resource oinker.</p>
<p>So far, the only real drawback is that Camino performs the worst of the three when I hit a page with any kind of serious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> on it. It usually swallows up the entirety of my (admittedly measley) G4 PowerBook's processor. Otherwise, Camino is the browser I count on not to crash, no matter how convoluted the JavaScript on a page, no matter what errors it might encounter while rendering a page.</p>
<p>Sorry, Safari. It makes me sad to say it, but you just don't pass muster.</p>
