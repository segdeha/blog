========

<a href="http://www.clearwired.com/sundial/">Sundial</a> is a widget for Mac OS X that makes <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> time tracking as simple as click, click, type, type, click. Click: Select a project. Click: Select a to-do item (optional). Type: Enter a description. Type: Enter the number of hours. Click: Save your time to Basecamp.

========

<p class="outdent">We are excited to offer this handy-dandy widget to the Basecamp community, free of charge. We are a Mac shop that uses Basecamp to share information with clients, manage projects, and to track our time. There are other Dashboard widgets out there that let you view projects, but until now there was nothing that let you easily track your time.</p>
