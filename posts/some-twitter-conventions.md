========

I feel a little dirty when I blog about <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I'm not an internet marketer shamelessly trying to drive traffic to my blog (not that there's anything <em>inherently</em> wrong with that). I'm just a Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/segdeha">user</a>, like you, and I have a couple of ideas to share.

========

<p class="outdent">Since its inception, Twitter has fostered in users a sense of ownership over the community, in part, by formally adopting conventions invented and propagated among the user base. The canonical example of this is @replies (now @mentions). If you put an @ sign followed immediately by someone's Twitter handle, Twitter.com automagically links it up to that user's profile.</p>

<p>Tweeters use different syntax for quoting and referring to other people's posts. E.g., if you saw a cool link and want to share it, but you want to give credit to the person who posted it first, you might do something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There is some <a href="http://blog.atebits.com/2009/01/rt-vs-via-round-2/">controversy</a> around whether (via ...) or RT (short for "retweet") is the better way to reference someone else's post. Personally, I use them in different situations. I do vias if I'm saying something original about the link. I RT if I'm just repeating something someone else said.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got to thinking about how some of these formats waste precious characters against the 140 limit. I was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> user back in the day, when you had to type in commands such as <code>/join #mindlessnattering</code> or <code>/me likes puppies</code> to do certain things. Now there's all manner of GUI for IRC and those damn kids are on my lawn again.</p>

<p>To make an already far-too-long story short, I've adopted IRC's command syntax in my tweets. Revolutionary, I know.</p>

<h3>Here are some examples:</h3>

<p><strong>/via</strong> – used for re-posting a link posted by someone else, but with original commentary</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>/by</strong> – used for posting a link for the first time, written by someone else</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>/cc</strong> – used for drawing someone's attention to the post</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>//</strong> – used for adding commentary to a RT</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can <em>even</em> combine them! Amaze your friends!</p>

<p>That's about it. I'd love to hear what you do or if you have any additions to this in the comments!</p>

<p>(Thanks @<a href="http://twitter.com/mclaughj">mclaughj</a> for prodding me to commit this to electrons!)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/5545343421">Chris Messina</a> independently came up with <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/new-microsyntax-for-twitter-three-pointers-and-the-slasher/">some similar ideas</a> to the ones I posted here. He's added <strong>/thx</strong> which is nice, but more importantly has given these things a name: <em>slashtags.</em> I like it!</p>
