========

I feel a little dirty when I blog about [Twitter](http://twitter.com/). I’m not an internet marketer shamelessly trying to drive traffic to my blog (not that there’s anything _inherently_ wrong with that). I’m just a Twitter [user](http://twitter.com/segdeha), like you, and I have a couple of ideas to share.

========

Since its inception, Twitter has fostered in users a sense of ownership over the community, in part, by formally adopting conventions invented and propagated among the user base. The canonical example of this is `@replies` (now `@mentions`). If you put an `@` sign followed immediately by someone’s Twitter handle, `Twitter.com` automagically links it up to that user’s profile.

Tweeters use different syntax for quoting and referring to other people’s posts. E.g., if you saw a cool link and want to share it, but you want to give credit to the person who posted it first, you might do something like the following:

There is some [controversy](http://blog.atebits.com/2009/01/rt-vs-via-round-2/) around whether (via ...) or RT (short for "retweet") is the better way to reference someone else’s post. Personally, I use them in different situations. I do vias if I’m saying something original about the link. I RT if I’m just repeating something someone else said.

Anyway, I got to thinking about how some of these formats waste precious characters against the 140 limit. I was an [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) user back in the day, when you had to type in commands such as `/join #mindlessnattering` or `/me likes puppies` to do certain things. Now there’s all manner of GUI for IRC and those damn kids are on my lawn again.

To make an already far-too-long story short, I’ve adopted IRC’s command syntax in my tweets. Revolutionary, I know.

### Here are some examples:

**/via** – used for re-posting a link posted by someone else, but with original commentary

> So you’ll recognize the jQuery team at conferences: [http://tr.im/zx7M](http://tr.im/zx7M) /via [@reybango](http://twitter.com/reybango)

**/by** – used for posting a link for the first time, written by someone else

> Truly geeky (ftw) blog for professional JavaScript developers: [http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/](http://pmuellr.blogspot.com/) /by [@pmuellr](http://twitter.com/pmuellr)

**/cc** – used for drawing someone’s attention to the post

> Visiting NZ? Here’s everything you need know about kiwi culture: [http://segdeha.com/kiwiculture/](http://segdeha.com/kiwiculture/) /cc [@kvnbishop](http://twitter.com/kvnbishop)

**//** – used for adding commentary to a RT

> RT [@reybango](http://twitter.com/reybango): [@rmurphey](http://twitter.com/rmurphey) Great talk! // Congrats, Rebecca!

You can _even_ combine them! Amaze your friends!

> NZ photography showcase: [http://www.eyeballnz.com/](http://www.eyeballnz.com/) /by [@eyeballnz](http://twitter.com/eyeballnz) /via [@audaciousgloop](http://twitter.com/audaciousgloop) /cc [@kvnbishop](http://twitter.com/kvnbishop)

That’s about it. I’d love to hear what you do or if you have any additions to this in the comments!

(Thanks [@mclaughj](http://twitter.com/mclaughj) for prodding me to commit this to electrons!)

**Update:** [Chris Messina](http://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/5545343421) independently came up with [some similar ideas](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/11/08/new-microsyntax-for-twitter-three-pointers-and-the-slasher/) to the ones I posted here. He’s added **/thx** which is nice, but more importantly has given these things a name: _slashtags._ I like it!
