========

Joel Spolsky [announced](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/09/15.html) [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) a few days ago. After mostly lurking since then, I posted [my first question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107054/) a little bit ago. 35 minutes later, I had a drop-in solution to my problem. Crikey, that was fast!

See that big-arse “S” to the left? Before [Eevee](https://stackoverflow.com/users/17875/eevee) came to my rescue, there would have been too much space between it and the rest of the paragraph. The problem was that I needed to push the [outdent](https://jontangerine.com/silo/typography/p/#outdent-cap) far enough left that über-wide Ws and Ms had room to breath. This meant that waif-like Is were so far out there they looked like they weren’t welcome at the typographic table.

Stack Overflow is a Q&A site for programmers. What makes it different from the hundreds (thousands?) of programming discussion forums (bless their hearts) is that users can vote up/down both questions and answers. This lets the cream rise to the top and the dreck fall to below the fold (that is, unless you have one of [these babies](https://www.neatorama.com/2006/11/27/thats-one-large-computer-monitor/)).

It’s not a revolutionary concept or anything. After all, [/.](https://slashdot.org) has been doing the community voting thing for a long time now. The difference between this site and other [reputation management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_management) sites is: a) this site is strictly Q&A, no discussions for you!, and b) it's all programmers so there’s not a lot of off-topic nattering on and (as I found out) there are some really clever people just waiting to share their expertise.

Developers are a skeptical lot. I’m no different, but from Joel’s description, it sounded like this site was done pretty smartly, so I was willing to give it a chance. After my experience today, I’m sold!
