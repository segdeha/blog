The revelation today of <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvseu7uDYI9vGyMHJCo51IdS-4twD8VAUFCG0">Eliot Spitzer&#8217;s involvement with high-priced prostitutes</a> constitutes a shot across the bow to politicians tempted to get cheeky this election season. Who&#8217;s in the cross-hairs next?

<p class="outdent">I don&#8217;t usually blog about politics, but today I&#8217;m making an exception because I haven&#8217;t seen this angle discussed anywhere.</p>
<p>The Bush administration routinely <a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/2007/080207.html">spies on Americans</a>. Surely then, they routinely spy on every politician in America. It would be silly not to, if you aren&#8217;t morally opposed to spying in the first place.</p>

<p>Today, it was revealed that Eliot Spitzer was caught &#8212; by a wiretap &#8212; visiting high-priced prostitutes. Consider that the timing of this story is just as we enter an election cycle. Might this not be a shot across the bow to every politician who&#8217;s running in November to &#8220;Mind your Ps and Qs or you&#8217;re next!&#8221;?</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m a politician with <em>anything</em> to hide (and, really, ain&#8217;t that pretty much all of them?), I&#8217;m on the phone <em>right now</em> ensuring I&#8217;m in the good graces of Bush, Cheney, and the rest of the overlords of darkness running the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m thoroughly disappointed that this happened. Eliot Spitzer was one of the &#8220;good guys.&#8221; He has fought his entire career against corruption. I think he was both wrong and hypocritical to break the law. I think his actions were incredibly insensitive to his wife and daughters. I also think his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer#Notable_cases">pedigree of fighting for the public interest</a> is exactly why he was targeted.</p>
