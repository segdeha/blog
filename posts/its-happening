Welcome to Mega Road Trip 2022â„¢!

My favorite GIF of all time is also the best one to portray how Iâ€™m feeling today, May 11, just 3 days before I depart on my Mega Road Trip 2022â„¢!

I think Iâ€™m in love. Thanks, Bend Teardrop!

So, yeah. Iâ€™m about to head out on a wee road trip. It has me both exhilarated and a bit terrified, to be honest!

The route as depicted above is just shy of 13,000 miles / 21,000 kms. I figure itâ€™s going to cost me 5 grand just in gas. ðŸ˜¬ Iâ€™ll be in the middle of nowhere by myself in many spots, but I will also be joined by Val in a couple of places and by my dad and younger daughter at another point.

I also plan to meet up with many of you whom I so presumptuously subscribed to this newsletter! I thought this could be a good way for you to keep up with my progress, in part so youâ€™ll be aware of when Iâ€™ll be rolling through your state or province.

With just a couple of days to go before I leave, Iâ€™m deep in the process of gathering gear and supplies and otherwise preparing for the trip. Yâ€™all know Iâ€™m not the best with details and this is so. many. details.

I donâ€™t know yet how often Iâ€™ll be sending out these newsletters, but please let me know if there are any topics youâ€™d like me to cover. And, please reply when you can with observations or even just emoji appropriate to the moment! ðŸ¥³

Next time you hear from me, Iâ€™ll likely be somewhere in the U.S. Southwest, far from the 50Â°F and rain we canâ€™t seem to shake here in Portland.

Until thenâ€¦

Andrew ðŸš™
