The Mac just turned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140207044840/www.apple.com/30-years/">30</a>. I&#8217;ve owned nothing but Macs for 24 of those years.

========

<p>My first computer wasn&#8217;t a Mac. It was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TI99-IMG_1680.jpg">TI-99/4A</a>. I perplexed my non-techie parents by saving up $230 working odd jobs during the summer of 1983 to buy it. I loved that thing. 16 colors, you hooked it up to your TV and when you turned it on you got nothing but  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> prompt.</p>
<p>It came with a manual that included a tutorial on how to program. I dove in and pretty soon was writing simple games and saving the programs to cassettes that sounded like modem chatter when you played them back.</p>
<p> I wrote a TRON cycle game, a maze game where you got chased by baddies, and a psychologist&#8217;s couch thing where you answered canned questions with canned responses. (None of these were particularly compelling, but I learned a lot!)</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t buy myself a Mac until 1990, but as soon as I did the same excitement I felt learning BASIC on my TI-99/4A came rushing back. This was pre-web, so what I got into was desktop publishing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus">Aldus</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker">PageMaker</a>. <em><a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1855631M/The_Mac_is_not_a_typewriter">The Mac is not a typewriter</a>.</em> So fun. I&#8217;m no designer, but I made hay with my Mac. Posters, brochures, training materials, resumes. I was a digital type master thanks to my Mac.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> for the first time. I remember thinking it was nice and all, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> was going to win because that&#8217;s where the content was!</p>
<p>My initial reaction quickly discredited, it wasn&#8217;t long before I was learning HTML 1.0, putting together <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/1995/">a simple presence for myself</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway">Information Superhighway</a>. My College of Education advisors weren&#8217;t sure what to do with me when I decided to write the terminal paper for my Master&#8217;s degree about <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/cmcandcsd.html">the potential effects of computer-mediated communication on college student development</a>.</p>
<p>3 years later, I quit a <s>promising</s> comfortable career in college student affairs and <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/equipoise/">hung out my shingle</a> as a freelance web developer.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, I didn&#8217;t know how little I knew. Maybe that&#8217;s a good thing. I didn&#8217;t know enough to be afraid to make that leap and it&#8217;s led to all manner of opportunities and job security in the 15 years since.</p>
<p>Anyway, this post was supposed to be a compendium of the Macs I&#8217;ve owned. Let&#8217;s get on with it.</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_lc/specs/mac_lc.html">Mac LC</a> – 256 colors, 13″ monitor, compact &#8220;pizza box&#8221; form factor&#8230;so much <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/25-years-of-hypercard-the-missing-link-to-the-web/">HyperCard</a> goodness.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_quadra/specs/mac_quadra_630.html">Quadra 630</a> – workhorse of a machine featuring the 68040 processor, FPU FTW!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/powercc/powertower_pro/powertower_pro180.html">PowerComputing PowerTower Pro</a> – yep, a clone!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g4/specs/powermac_g4_450.html">Power Mac G4</a> – this is the one that was supposed to ship at 500MHz, but was dropped to 450MHz due to CPU yield problems. I wrote Steve Jobs to complain (as did a fair number of us in the same boat) and Apple did the right thing and gave us a bit of money back.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ibook/specs/ibook_700_2.html">iBook G3</a> – first laptop I owned and I was hooked, didn&#8217;t buy another desktop machine until my Mac mini.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.0_15.html">15″ PowerBook G4</a> – 1GHz CPU, 1GB of RAM&#8230;oh the symmetry!</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook_2.0_black.html">MacBook</a> – why, yes, I did pay the additional 50 bucks for black.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.66-aluminum-15-mid-2009-sd-unibody-specs.html">15″ MacBook Pro</a> – I didn&#8217;t technically buy this one, it was a parting gift when <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/digg-to-lay-off-37-percentof-staff/">I was laid off from Digg</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-2-duo-2.4-mid-2010-specs.html">Mac mini</a> – bought it as a media machine, hooked it up to an HD TV. Never really felt like the right approach. I recently replaced it with an <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/apple-tv/specs/apple-tv-3rd-generation-early-2013-specs.html">Apple TV</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="">13″ MacBook Pro with Retina Display</a> – this is the recent rev running Mavericks that gives you, like, 12 hours of battery life. The display is amazeballs. It&#8217;s super light. This is the perfect computer, in my opinion.</li>
</ol>
<p>How far we&#8217;ve come since 1990. My Mac LC set me back more than $2,000 even with my .edu discount. My retina MacBook Pro cost me less than $1,000. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s law</a>, indeed.</p>
<p>Specs aside, it&#8217;s what my Macs have enabled me to do that truly blows my mind. I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d be doing for work if not for this incredible tool. Thank you Apple. Thank you Steve.</p>
