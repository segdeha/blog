In honor of their 10th anniversary, Google have made available [search as it was in 2001](https://www.google.com/search2001.html) (love the exclamation point on the logo, guys!).

========

So, I did what probably 90% of people did upon hearing this news: [I Googled my name!](https://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=andrew+hedges&btnG=Google+Search)

On the 2001 web, I came up #2 out of the 22,400 results. That compares to [now](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-au&q=andrew+hedges&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) where I come up #1 out of 1,090,000 results.

I’m pretty sure I didn’t author those additional 1,067,600 pages. Where did they all come from?
