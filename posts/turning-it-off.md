========

I&#8217;ve decided social media (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Foursquare, etc.) isn&#8217;t contributing anything meaningful to my life and may, in fact, be hurting my life in significant ways. So, I&#8217;m turning it off. If you want to talk, you either already have my phone number or can email me through the link at the bottom of this page.

<p>Search teh Googlez for &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=17&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=social+media+false+connection" title="LMGTFY">social media false connection</a>&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see over 22 million results, including <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/201010/the-false-face-our-social-media-persona" title="The False Face of Our Social Media Persona ... ever notice how everyone has an 'awesome(!!!)' life on Facebook and Twitter?">this one</a> that states the problem quite plainly:</p>
<blockquote>
[S]ocial media introduces two parallel and paradoxical elements&#8212;false intimacy and social distance.
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a few friends <span class="tooltip" title="In Real Life">IRL</span> through Twitter. I&#8217;ve been able to keep up on some of the goings on of friends and family through Facebook. But, it&#8217;s no substitute for face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>That, and social media is a huge time sink for me. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/147/doctor-love.html?page=0,2" title="Social Networking Affects Brains Like Falling in Love ... except that it's not falling in love, it's typing into a computer screen">It&#8217;s like crack</a> and I don&#8217;t have the discipline to reduce my consumption, so it&#8217;s cold turkey for me. There are things I want to do and the hours I&#8217;ll get back from this change will help me immensely to do them.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I&#8217;m unplugging. Mostly. I&#8217;ll still post photos to Instagram, but no longer spammed out to Twitter and Facebook and Foursquare. Yeah, maybe that&#8217;s hypocritical. Oh well. The difference for me is that Instagram is not a time suck.</p>
<p>So, drop me an email, give me a call, stop by my house. Let&#8217;s grab a coffee or a drink or a meal. Let&#8217;s go to a park and throw a frisbee or bump around a volleyball. Let&#8217;s go hiking, camping, beach combing, wine tasting. Let&#8217;s connect in real time, in real life. Just don&#8217;t expect to see me on the social medias. At least for now.</p>
