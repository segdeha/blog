========

There&#8217;ve been a couple of false starts over the <em>2 years</em> that I&#8217;ve been developing this <a title="Visit PHPfr on Apple.com" href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/phpfunctionreference.html">Dashboard widget</a>, so excuse me if I didn&#8217;t want to say anything until I knew a release was close, but PHP Function Reference 1.0 is nearly done. w00+!

========

<p class="outdent">It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s been over 2 years since I first released <a title="See the current version here" href="http://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/#phpfr">PHPfr</a> to the public. I didn&#8217;t even realize it had been that long until I was looking at the version history recently. To say it has been difficult to maintain momentum on this project is an understatement.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I <a title="Visit the project home on Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/phpfr/">open sourced</a> it, hoping that would spark some progress. Three talented people joined the project at that time, but we got busy at <a title="Vianet International" href="http://vianet.travel/">work</a> and I wasn&#8217;t able to do much with it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s come over me in the last week. I really am too busy to be spending this kind of time on a <em>free</em> widget. I guess this truly is a labour of love.</p>

		PHPfr 0.9.6.2b (yes, the version number is a joke)

<p>In human development circles, they talk about things happening spontaneously when there is a &#8220;readiness&#8221; for them. I think that&#8217;s a part of why this is coming together now. I&#8217;m twice the programmer I was a year ago, having worked on more complex projects over that time than I ever had before. Features that would have been a hard slog a year ago have come together in a matter of hours this time around.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, PHPfr 1.0 is <em>finally</em> closing in on release candidate status. To their credit, Kelly Patrick Robinson and Barbara Napholtz, 2 of the 3 people who came on board a year ago, are back on the bandwagon (a big help, thanks, you two!). Also, we have our fist localization (German) thanks to <a href="http://blog.tice.de/">Tice Klussmeier</a>. Good stuff!</p>
<p>So, watch this space in the next couple of weeks for the all new, completely redesigned, better than ever, PHP Function Reference widget!</p>
