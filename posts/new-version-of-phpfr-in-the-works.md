========

There’ve been a couple of false starts over the _2 years_ that I’ve been developing this [Dashboard widget](https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/phpfunctionreference.html), so excuse me if I didn’t want to say anything until I knew a release was close, but PHP Function Reference 1.0 is nearly done. w00+!

========

It’s hard to believe it’s been over 2 years since I first released [PHPfr](https://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/#phpfr) to the public. I didn’t even realize it had been that long until I was looking at the version history recently. To say it has been difficult to maintain momentum on this project is an understatement.

About a year ago, I [open sourced](https://code.google.com/p/phpfr/) it, hoping that would spark some progress. Three talented people joined the project at that time, but we got busy at [work](http://vianet.travel) and I wasn’t able to do much with it.

Honestly, I don’t know what’s come over me in the last week. I really am too busy to be spending this kind of time on a _free_ widget. I guess this truly is a labour of love.

In human development circles, they talk about things happening spontaneously when there is a “readiness” for them. I think that’s a part of why this is coming together now. I’m twice the programmer I was a year ago, having worked on more complex projects over that time than I ever had before. Features that would have been a hard slog a year ago have come together in a matter of hours this time around.

Whatever the reason, PHPfr 1.0 is _finally_ closing in on release candidate status. To their credit, Kelly Patrick Robinson and Barbara Napholtz, 2 of the 3 people who came on board a year ago, are back on the bandwagon (a big help, thanks, you two!). Also, we have our fist localization (German) thanks to [Tice Klussmeier](https://blog.tice.de/). Good stuff!

So, watch this space in the next couple of weeks for the all new, completely redesigned, better than ever, PHP Function Reference widget!
