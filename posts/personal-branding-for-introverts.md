There&#8217;s never been a better time in human history to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introvert">introvert</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">intertubes</a> give those of us of the less outgoing persuasion a powerful vehicle for exposure, on our own terms.

<p class="outdent">&#8220;My name is Andrew, and I&#8217;m an introvert.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a dirty word. &#8220;Introvert.&#8221; Western societies tend to value life-of-the-party types over people like me. I love getting together with a couple of friends and getting all deep and meaningful. For me, flitting around a room filled with people I barely know falls just below &#8220;get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding">waterboarded</a>&#8221; on my list of to-dos.</p>
<p>If you are unsure for which team you bat, consider the following statements (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introvert#Measurement">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ol>
	<li>I am the life of the party.</li>
	<li>I enjoy being the center of attention.</li>
	<li>I am skilled in handling social situations.</li>
	<li>I like to be where the action is.</li>
	<li>I make new friends easily.</li>
	<li>I am quiet around strangers.</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t like to draw attention to myself.</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t like to party on the weekends.</li>
	<li>I like to work independently.</li>
	<li>I often enjoy spending time by myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>If most of 1-5 ring true for you and most of 6-10 don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re probably an extrovert. If the opposite is true, you&#8217;re probably an introvert. If you fall pretty evenly in both camps, you may be an ambivert. Kinky.</p>
<h3>Me, a brand?</h3>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_branding">you, a brand</a>. If, <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/folio/">like me</a>, you make your living as an independent contractor, freelancer, or consultant, your &#8220;brand&#8221; is your most valuable asset.</p>
<p>Even if you work in a large company, your brand can affect work assignments, promotions, etc. So, hey, you at IBM, keep reading!</p>
<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m about to spout off about what the term &#8220;brand&#8221; means. I&#8217;m not a marketing expert, so&#8212;if you are&#8212;please feel free to clarify and correct me in the comments.</em></p>
<p>In the simplest terms, a brand is what people associate with a person, company, or organization. So, a personal brand is basically what people think of when they think of you.</p>
<p>E.g., consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kournikova">Anna Kournikova</a>. What comes to mind? Sexy. Athletic. Pretty. Not the world&#8217;s greatest tennis player, but who really cares?</p>
<p>Now, consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>. Big brained dude. Inventor of the black hole. World&#8217;s smartest person. Not who you&#8217;d choose to back you up in a bar fight, but your absolute top choice for the &#8220;phone a friend&#8221; lifeline on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_To_Be_A_Millionaire">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</a>.</p>
<p>What do people think of when they think of you? That&#8217;s your personal brand.</p>
<h3>Ate Bran Flakes for breakfast. Reading the newspaper. Cat has herpes.</h3>
<p>At first blush, social networking would seem to favor the extrovert. People willing to share the minutae of their lives are, after all, the primary target audience for services like <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, right?</p>
<p>Yes and no. Sure, there are heaps of people tweeting the mundane, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be one of them. It is possible to use Twitter, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, etc. to positively affect your personal brand.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/segdeha">I&#8217;m on Twitter.</a> I&#8217;ve built up a reasonably high-value following there, even earning the label of &#8220;persona&#8221; according to Klout, a Twitter influence analysis site.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://klout.com/profile/summary/segdeha/">my Klout summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
You have built a personal brand around your identity. There is a good chance that you work in social media or marketing but you might even be famous in real life. Being a persona is not just about having a ton of followers, to make it to the top right corner you need to engage with your audience. Make no mistake about it though, when you talk people listen.
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t set out to be a Twitter &#8220;persona.&#8221; I am neither famous, nor do I work in social media or marketing. What happened is that, as an introvert, I naturally tend not to tweet about every little detail of my day, preferring to tweet about stuff directly related to my work as a web developer as well as engaging with others of like mind. There is a bit of the personal in there, but by mostly keeping it focused, my tweet stream is more valuable.</p>
<h3>The introvert advantage</h3>
<p>What do you think? Is there more information out there than you have the ability to process? I thought so.</p>
<p>I love extroverts. Some of my best friends are extroverts. But, here&#8217;s the thing: extroverts tend to say whatever&#8217;s on their mind. Some go as far as to say seemingly <em>everything</em> that&#8217;s on their mind. When that gets amplified by social media, it&#8217;s overload.</p>
<p>Introverts tend to think about what they want to say before they say it. If it&#8217;s already been said by someone else, we don&#8217;t feel the need to say it again. If, after a discussion has run its course, there are important points left uncovered, we chime in. For that reason, when an introvert opens her mouth, people tend to pay attention.</p>
<p>Attention is valuable.</p>
<p>The social media race goes not to the swift of keystroke, but to those with the ability to say the most in the simplest terms.</p>
<p>I believe we, as introverts, have a unique ability to focus our attention on the most salient information, synthesize it into digestible concepts and express it in a modicum of words. In a world marketplace increasingly driven more by &#8220;word of text&#8221; than &#8220;word of mouth,&#8221; that gives us a powerful lever for shaping a personal brand.</p>
