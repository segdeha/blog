========

I told you that I didn’t have great luck with blog series. Maybe I jinxed myself, but soon after I penned [entry 0](/blog/2008/05/13/widget-javascript-the-un-series-part-0), we had an announcement at work that’s thrown my life into a bit of disarray.

========

[Vianet](https://vianet.travel) is closing the [Kerikeri](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Kerikeri,+Northland,+New+Zealand&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr) office (where I work). So, I’m in the process of getting the family ready to move to the North Shore, nearer the [Takapuna](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Takapuna,+Auckland,+New+Zealand&ie=UTF8&z=15&iwloc=addr) office.

I knew it wasn’t a good idea to announce a series of blog posts. But, I do intend to keep going with it when things are more settled.

One positive thing that has come about as a result of this upheaval is [this](https://uncompany.co.nz).
