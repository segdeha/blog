========

I made my first soup tonight. I’ve never blogged a recipe before, but I’m so pleased with the result I can’t help but share.

========

When I was growing up, my step-dad (the kindest man I know) used to make big pots of soup every so often. He’d throw together whatever was sitting about the fridge and garden, add some mysterious combination of spices (probably just salt and pepper, but still), and we’d eat like kings for a week off the leftovers. I dedicate this, my first real (read: non-ramen) soup, to him!

* 1 package of [Smart Bacon](http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=smartbacon) (or equivalent) … This. Is. Key.
* 2 medium russet potatoes (or 3 or 4 medium new potatoes if russets aren’t available where you live [I’m looking at you New Zealand])
* 3 medium carrots
* 1 small cabbage
* 1 or 2 large broccoli floret
* 1 large yellow onion
* 1 block of firm tofu, if you want a little extra protein
* 1 - 2 Serrano peppers (I like heat; I used 2 and I wouldn’t want it any more spicy)
* 3 or 4 dashes of Chipotle flavored hot sauce (I used [Cholula](http://cholula.com/hot_sauce_flavors/chipotle_hot_sauce.php)…mmm)
* 2 quarts (1900ml) of vegetable stock
* Salt and pepper to taste (don’t be shy, this makes the soup, in my opinion)
* A teaspoon or so of chopped rosemary (just because I had it lying around)

Serves: er…I don’t know, a [fireteam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireteam)?

A pequeño trick I learned from [Paco](http://twitter.com/kidpollo) that I think makes a difference is that I “roasted” the Serranos before adding them to the soup. All this entails is cooking the whole peppers in a skillet on medium/high heat, turning them a couple of times over the course of 2 or 3 minutes. This brings out the oil a little, making the heat a little more refined.


Chop everything up. Throw it all in a gallon soup pot. Bring to a boil, then simmer for a couple of hours (until the potatoes break up easily with a fork). Violà!
