I have my own secret sauce for filtering out comment spam from my blog. I thought it would be interesting to let it all through on one post.

========

<p>It&#8217;s been 4 years—almost to the day—since I first blogged about <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/blog/2008/12/26/defeating-comment-spam">my solution to comment spam</a>.<p>
<p>As my friend, <a href="http://www.storytotell.org/">Daniel</a>, said in the first comment of that post, my blog was not notorious enough to warrant paid spammers (still isn&#8217;t, in fact), so really the enemy was, and still is, automated comment spam.</p>
<p>As of May 15, 2009, I had received 3,431 total comment submissions. 57 of those were legitimate comments. 3,374 were spam submissions. I&#8217;d had 18 false positives (spam messages that leaked through) and 1 false negative (legitimate comment that was flagged as spam).</p>
<p>As of today, 3½ years later, I have received 36,016 total comment submissions. 173 of those have been legitimate comments (thanks for those!). <strong>35,843</strong> have been spam submissions. I&#8217;ve had 24 false positives and 151 false negatives for a <strong>99.995% success rate.</strong></p>
<p>Again, this post will let through all manner of <em>sturm und drang.</em></p>
<p>Let the spamming begin!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve turned off spam comments to this post and will follow up with a bit of analysis of my experiment soon!</p>
