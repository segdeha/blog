========

It&#8217;s done, finished, out the door, in the can. Version one-point-oh of my <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/widgets/#phpfr">PHP Function Reference</a> (aka, <em>PHPfr</em>) widget is officially available for download. And, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oh+my+dog">oh my dog</a>, it&#8217;s about time.

========

<p class="outdent">Two years in the making, PHPfr has spent way more time <em>not</em> in development than in it. After many late nights in front of my MacBook over the last few weeks, I am relieved and excited that the time has finally come to share the finished product with the world.</p>
<p>I always find it a little thrilling when I release software. It&#8217;s like being an expectant father, the nervousness, the anticipation. Will everything turn out all right? Will others think it&#8217;s as beautiful as I do?</p>

<p>1.0 is up on <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/29415">VersionTracker</a> now and I&#8217;m seeing a pretty good flow of downloads come through. It should get through Apple&#8217;s vetting process in the next day or so. Then the real fun begins!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/phpfunctionreference.html">listing on Apple.com</a> has historically accounted for at least three quarters of my downloads, maybe more, though it&#8217;s hard to know for sure because Apple don&#8217;t provide stats on this kind of thing. This time I have sorted a way to track it, so I ought to be able to report back some pretty accurate numbers in a few weeks.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s done for now. There aren&#8217;t any major <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpfr/issues/list">bugs</a> that have been reported so far. I will release a minor point version when I get a couple of additional localizations back this week.</p>
<p>I want to, <a href="/blog/2008/03/30/new-version-of-phpfr-in-the-works">again</a>, send out a big thank you to everyone who contributed to this release! PHPfr wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without you!</p>
