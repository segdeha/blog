Thanks, but I'm not looking for a Russian bride and somehow I doubt yours is really a "trusted pharmacy."

<p class="outdent">Comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_in_blogs">spam</a> is a scourge, as we all know.</p>
<p>I don't claim to be an expert on these things, but I have stumbled on a set of techniques that have been 100% accurate for preventing comment spam on this blog. And, no, it's not security through obscurity, smart ass.</p>
<p>I log every comment form submission, spam or not. Since I implemented my system a month ago, I have had 189 submissions. Of those, 11 were legitimate comments. The rest were spam.</p>
<p>All of the legitimate comments were published immediately. None of the spam comments were published. Not bad, eh?</p>
<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/segdeha/statuses/1061986494">promised</a>, the following slides explain in some detail the system I've implemented. I welcome your comments on these techniques below.</p>
