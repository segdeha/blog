<a title="They in this context being Charles Caleb Colton" href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27484.html">They say</a> imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. They also say there is a fine line between imitation and inspiration. Gentle reader, I leave it for you to decide on which side of this line the following falls.

<p class="outdent">I helped build <a href="http://www.travelbug.co.nz/">Travelbug</a>, <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/">Trade Me&#8217;s</a> online accommodation booking site. We launched Travelbug on 9 September, 2007. Today, it came to my attention that a direct competitor has, essentially, lifted a major feature of the site.</p>
<p>The feature in question (coded primarily by me, coincidentally) is the booking calendar. You can see it in action by visiting any <a href="http://www.travelbug.co.nz/visit/19160#book">location page</a> on the Travelbug site. It shows about a week&#8217;s worth of availability at a time, giving you the ability to scroll ahead and back, and allows you to start the booking process using a neat-o, visual interface. </p>

<p>Location pages also contain basic info like name and address, amenities, photos, and a Google Map of the location. Makes sense.</p>
<p>I guess <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/575-but-theres-only-so-many-ways-to-do-something-right">there are only so many ways</a> to display some of that basic info so I could forgive some similarities there. But, the booking calendar widget, while obvious once you see and use it, was pretty original in its conception and execution. Or, so I thought&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the folks at <a href="http://www.jasons.com/">Jasons</a> had the same idea, without ever having seen Travelbug. OK, it&#8217;s not actually possible. At least, I don&#8217;t think so, after looking at what they offer on their site.</p>
<p>Name, address, check. Description, list of amenities, check. Photos, Google Map, check. Scrolling booking calendar&#8230;hey, haven&#8217;t I seen that somewhere before?</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t my design. I only implemented it. From what I understand, the Trade Me guys are having a laugh about the whole thing, which is big of them. If it were me, I&#8217;d be fairly livid about this blatant plagiarism. I guess they&#8217;re more secure in their design-hood.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the thing I find interesting is that their page uses 2 or 3 different JavaScript animation libraries (<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">YUI</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Script.aculo.us</a> for sure, and one that looks like a .NET kinda thing) and weighs in at over <strong>1.3MB,</strong> roughly <em>quadruple</em> ours. Just saying.</p>
