I told you that I didn&#8217;t have great luck with blog series. Maybe I jinxed myself, but soon after I penned <a href="http://andrew.hedges.name/blog/2008/05/13/widget-javascript-the-un-series-part-0">entry 0</a>, we had an announcement at work that&#8217;s thrown my life into a bit of disarray.

========

<p class="outdent"><a href="http://vianet.travel/">Vianet</a> is closing the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Kerikeri,+Northland,+New+Zealand&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr">Kerikeri</a> office (where I work). So, I&#8217;m in the process of getting the family ready to move to the North Shore, nearer the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Takapuna,+Auckland,+New+Zealand&ie=UTF8&z=15&iwloc=addr">Takapuna</a> office.</p>
<p>I knew it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to announce a series of blog posts. But, I do intend to keep going with it when things are more settled.</p>
<p>One positive thing that has come about as a result of this upheaval is <a href="http://uncompany.co.nz/">this</a>.</p>
