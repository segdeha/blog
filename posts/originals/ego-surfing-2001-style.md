In honor of their 10th anniversary, Google have made available <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001.html">search as it was in 2001</a> (love the exclamation point on the logo, guys!).

<p class="outdent">So, I did what probably 90% of people did upon hearing this news: <a href="http://www.google.com/search2001/search?hl=en&q=andrew+hedges&btnG=Google+Search">I Googled my name!</a></p>
<p>On the 2001 web, I came up #2 out of the 22,400 results. That compares to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-au&q=andrew+hedges&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">now</a> where I come up #1 out of 1,090,000 results.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I didn't author those additional 1,067,600 pages. Where did they all come from?</p>
