========

I made my first soup tonight. I&#8217;ve never blogged a recipe before, but I&#8217;m so pleased with the result I can&#8217;t help but share.

========

<p class="dedent">When I was growing up, my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000792808537">step-dad</a> (the kindest man I know) used to make big pots of soup every so often. He&#8217;d throw together whatever was sitting about the fridge and garden, add some mysterious combination of spices (probably just salt and pepper, but still), and we&#8217;d eat like kings for a week off the leftovers. I dedicate this, my first real (read: non-ramen) soup, to him!</p>

<ul>
     <li>1 package of <a href="http://www.lightlife.com/product_detail.jsp?p=smartbacon">Smart Bacon</a> (or equivalent) &#8230; This. Is. Key.</li>
    <li>2 medium russet potatoes (or 3 or 4 medium new potatoes if russets aren&#8217;t available where you live [I&#8217;m looking at you New Zealand])</li>
     <li>3 medium carrots</li>
     <li>1 small cabbage</li>
     <li>1 or 2 large broccoli floret</li>
     <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
     <li>1 block of firm tofu, if you want a little extra protein</li>
     <li>1 - 2 Serrano peppers (I like heat; I used 2 and I wouldn&#8217;t want it any more spicy)</li>
     <li>3 or 4 dashes of Chipotle flavored hot sauce (I used <a href="http://cholula.com/hot_sauce_flavors/chipotle_hot_sauce.php">Cholula</a>&#8230;mmm)</li>
     <li>2 quarts (1900ml) of vegetable stock</li>
     <li>Salt and pepper to taste (don&#8217;t be shy, this makes the soup, in my opinion)</li>
     <li>A teaspoon or so of chopped rosemary (just because I had it lying around)</li>
</ul>

<p>A peque&#241;o trick I learned from <a href="http://twitter.com/kidpollo">Paco</a> that I think makes a difference is that I &#8220;roasted&#8221; the Serranos before adding them to the soup. All this entails is cooking the whole peppers in a skillet on medium/high heat, turning them a couple of times over the course of 2 or 3 minutes. This brings out the oil a little, making the heat a little more refined.</p>

<p>Chop everything up. Throw it all in a gallon soup pot. Bring to a boil, then simmer for a couple of hours (until the potatoes break up easily with a fork). Viol&#224;!</p>
