<a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google Labs</a> has done it again. The company that made it OK to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a> now lets programmers search the source code of jillions (that's a technical term) of software projects. OK, so this probably isn't news to developers out there, but the reason I'm excited about it is a little more personal.

<p class="outdent">For kicks and grins, I decided to <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=widgetcontrol&btnG=Search">search for <code>widgetControl</code></a>, the name of a function I wrote for <a href="http://www.clearwired.com/sundial/">Sundial</a>. Sure enough, Sundial is the #1 result. Boy howdy! Even cooler is that the way Google found this was by grabbing Sundial from <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/22763">MacUpdate.com</a> and reading the zipped widget bundle. The kicker, though, is that clicking on <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=+widgetcontrol+show:sZsmSiU0qPQ:wGHCsa5KWXY:SVnnuhm2D8M&sa=N&cd=1&ct=rc&cs_p=http://www.macupdate.com/download.php/22763/Sundial.wdgt.zip&cs_f=Sundial.wdgt/LocalResources/Sundial.js#a0"><code>Sundial.wdgt/LocalResources/Sundial.js</code></a> takes you right into the source code.</p>

<p>You can then browse up the directory tree and into any of the files in the bundle. Sweet! Oh, and a nice touch is that when looking at the source code, you can step through the instances of the search term by hitting "n" on your keyboard.</p>

<p>Forget the implications for software development; this opens up a whole new avenue for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosurfing">ego-surfing</a>...</p>
