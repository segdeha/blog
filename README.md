Because…why not build your own blog software in 2020? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## what i’m actually doing

The code to run the blog lives on my web host. This repo is just a convenient way for me to author posts. How it works is when I commit a new or updated post, the Markdown files in the `/posts/` directory get FTPed to my web host. That’s kind of it.

## backstory, not that anyone’s interested but me…

I’ve done this before. The previous iteration of my blog was powered by a PHP/MySQL application that I built from scratch. It was a good learning exercise, but way overengineered compared to what I now understand is what I want: a simple, fast way to publish short articles. I’ve decided over these intervening years that I don’t need commenting, tag clouds, lists of most popular posts, etc.
